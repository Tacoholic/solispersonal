When I initially started writing tests in Cypress, there was A LOT of DRY code. As time has passed, I have come to practice the following when writing automated tests:  if there’s an opportunity to refactor, so that you get rid of DRY code, you should. 

In this example, I was testing form validation; There are 8 text inputs on this form, and I needed to make sure that you cannot enter more than 100 characters per input. If you do, an alert will appear saying that it’s invalid.

This is how I initially had it written:
```
describe("Form Validation", () => {
  TestRunner.addTestCase("Inputs cannot surpass 100 characters", () => {
    cy.get(`[formcontrolname="input1"]`).type(text);
    cy.get(`[formcontrolname="input2"]`).type(text);
    cy.get(`[formcontrolname="input3"]`).type(text);
    cy.get(`[formcontrolname="input4"]`).type(text);
    cy.get(`[formcontrolname="input5"]`).type(text);
    cy.get(`[formcontrolname="input6"]`).type(text);
    cy.get(`[formcontrolname="input7"]`).type(text);
    cy.get(`[formcontrolname="input8"]`).type(text);
  });
});
```
As you can see, there is a lot repetition of the same code.

After doing some research, I realized that there was a way to refactor this: create an array that I can loop through.

So I started by creating the array which stores the formcontrolnames:

```
const formNamesData = [
    "input1",
    "input2",
    "input3",
    "input4",
    "input5",
    "input6",
    "input7",
    "input8"
];
```

Next, I used a forEach loop to iterate through the _formNamesData_
```
describe("Form Validation", () => {
    const formNamesData = [
    "input1",
    "input2",
    "input3",
    "input4",
    "input5",
    "input6",
    "input7",
    "input8"
];

const randomText = ._.times(105, () => _.random(35).toString(36)).join("");

  TestRunner.addTestCase("Inputs cannot surpass 100 characters", () => {
    formNamesData.forEach((formName) => {
        HelperMethods.typeTextIntoInput(formName, randomText);
        cy.get(".error-alert")
        .should("exist")
        .and("contain",`${formName} must be shorter than or equal to 100 characters`);
    })
  });
});

//Helper Method
public typeTextIntoInput(formControlName:string, text:string){
    cy.get(`[formcontrolname="${formControlName}"]`).type(text);
}

```

So I used a forEach loop to iterate through the formcontrol names on the form.  Within
that loop, I called on a helper method _typeTextIntoInput()_ that will type text _(randomText)_
into each text input seperately. Finally, I wrote an assert that checks that the alert is visible and 
that the text within that alert matches the proper form where the error is ocurring. 
## Conclusion
Using an array to store data and then loop through it is a great way to avoid and/or reduce DRY code.  In my case, 
I have been able to reduce the amount of lines code signifanctly, making my tests more robust and easier to read.
