When I got hired at my current job, the testing suite was in its early stages.  
My job was to come in and add more test coverage to the suite.  


Initially, when I was  writing my tests, I used to query an element by getting its classname. 
For instance, to create a click action, I would write up the command the following way:

```cy.get(".classname").click();```

There is nothing wrong, at least I thought, with the way I had written the tests. They were working and passing. Life in the testing world was good until refactor time came around. 
As a result, several tests were failing. 
They weren’t failing because my tests were written bad 
or because there was an actual bug. These tests were failing because the classnames were changing 
as a result of changes in the developers code. 


I realized that this could potentially happen again in the future - tests failing because there was a change in the classname. 

I came across the concept of using data-test-attributes.  This was a game changer! 
So instead of querying an element by using a classname, with a data test attribute, I now query an element the following way:

```cy.get(`[data-test-id=”idName”]`).click();```

## Conclusion
The biggest takeaway is that data test attributes are designed for testing purposes only.  So no matter how many changes are done in the developers code, a data test attribute is shield from those changes.   A regular id (#id) will not be 100 percent shielded since it can be used for css styling and/or Javascript functionality.
